Developer's homework

This readme file describes a usage of PaymentTracker program which was made as a backend developer's homework.

AUTHOR: Michal Mihalik.

ENVIRONMENT: java (jdk1.8.0_131)

VERSION: 1.0

USAGE:
1. add 3-letter currency with amount e.g.: USD 100.5
2. add exchange rate for currency with '*' command e.g.: * CZK 22.166
3. add file with commands like in 1st and 2nd step with '+' command e.g.: + input.txt
NOTE 1: please use the same decimal separator as defined in your system locale. Usually it is '.' or ','.
NOTE 2: You can also run this app with one arg which will be taken as a file name with the same behavior as in point 3.

ABOUT THIS VERSION
This is an initial version of developer's homework. It can be extended if necessary.

EXTENSION SUGGESTIONS:
1. repository structure can be done in standard way as trunk, branches, tags. I found this not necessary in this version but it can be done if needed.
2. program can be extended with setting of a decimal separator.
3. output can go to file.
4. also GUI can be developed.
5. also javadoc can be added.

Please contact me if necessary.
